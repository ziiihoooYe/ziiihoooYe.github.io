Hi, I am Zihao Ye (叶子皓), which means 'Luminous Leaf' in the cultural context of China.

My research interests mainly lie in machine learning and signal processing. For more details, please check my [bio](/cv/).

I obtained my B.Sc. at joint programme between QMUL and BUPT, worked with [Prof. Changjae Oh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~coh/index.html), in 2023.

I am also a guitarist 🎸 and a music lover.
