Hi, I am Zihao Ye (Âè∂Â≠êÁöì), which means 'Luminous Leaf' in the cultural context of China. I am currently an MS student in the Artificial Intelligence Engineering - Information Security program at Carnegie Mellon University.

My research interests mainly lie in machine learning and signal processing. My previous experience can be found in my [bio](/cv/).

I obtained my B.Eng. through a joint program between Queen Mary University of London and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, worked with [Prof. Changjae Oh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~coh/index.html), in 2023.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also a guitarist üé∏ and a music lover.
