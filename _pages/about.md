Hi, I am Zihao Ye (叶子皓), which means “Luminous Leaf” in the cultural context of China. I am currently an M.Sc. student in the Artificial Intelligence Engineering - Information Security program at Carnegie Mellon University.

My current research interests are representation learning theory and application. My previous experience can be found in my [bio](/cv/).

I obtained my B.Sc. through a joint program between Queen Mary University of London and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and I worked with [Prof. Changjae Oh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~coh/index.html), in 2023.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also passionate about music. I play guitar 🎸 and sing.
