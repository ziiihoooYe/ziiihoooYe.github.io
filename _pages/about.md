Hi, I am Zihao Ye (叶子皓), which means 'Luminous Leaf' in the cultural context of China.

My research interests mainly lie in machine learning and signal processing. For more details, please check my bio.

I obtained my B.Sc. at joint programme between QMUL and BUPT, worked with Prof. Changjae Oh, in 2023.

I am also a guitarist :guitar: and a music lover.
