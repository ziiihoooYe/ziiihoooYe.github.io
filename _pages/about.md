Hi, I am Zihao Ye (叶子皓), which means “Luminous Leaf” in the cultural context of China. I am currently an M.Sc. student in the Artificial Intelligence Engineering - Information Security program at Carnegie Mellon University.

My research interests mainly lie in machine learning and signal processing. My previous experience can be found in my [bio](/cv/).

I obtained my B.Sc. through a joint program between Queen Mary University of London and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and I worked with [Prof. Changjae Oh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~coh/index.html), in 2023.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also a guitarist 🎸 and a music lover.
